<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>This is an application that you can use to implement Thomas Saaty's <em>Analytic Hierarchy Process</em> or <em>AHP</em>.</p>

<p>
I have yet to implement a persistence layer, so everything you do will persist only until you navigate away from this page (that is, this subsection of the outer site).
</p>

<p>In brief, the <em>AHP</em> is a multi-criteria analysis framework that decision makers can use to evalute priorities.  As an example, suppose you have a series of road projects that you need to rank in order to determine bugetary constraints and setup a timeline for implementation.</p>

<p>Within the larger setting of your decision, you first put together a set of criteria that you believe will factor in to your planning.</p>

<p>Next you will divide these criteria into subcriteria, and so on, until you have developed a sufficiently detailed hierarchy of criteria.</p>

<p>
To learn about the theory behind the <em>AHP</em>, check out this article <a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/0270025587904738/1-s2.0-0270025587904738-main.pdf?_tid=cd28fa40-6a63-11e6-aa0b-00000aab0f26&acdnat=1472088935_18c7589862ab893fbb0b7c21483e7072" target="_blank">Analytic Hierarchy Process</a>.		
</p>

<p>
	The process itself consists of three easy steps that follow in an iterative fashion, circularly.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Define hierarchy 
	</li>
	<li>
		Compare the criteria in pairs
	</li>
	<li>
		Calculate and review the results
	</li>
	<li>
		Revise 1 or 2 based on 3
	</li>
</ol>

<p>To see an example hierarchy, just click on the "Hiearchy" tab above!</p>

<p>This app was built using Angular 2, Typescript, D3.js v4, and Numeric Javascript.  It lives in my "blog", which is a Laravel 5.1 web application.</p>
